**Introduction**

**mySpace** is a system that manages the records of students and faculty members regarding results, examination, personal information etc. Through mySpace, extensive information will be available at your fingertips and at any time. Viewing student data, allocating classes and reshuffling, managing semester information, examination dates, subject management, result declaration and related issues are made simple and easy. mySpace will allow keeping data in a form that can be easily accessed and analysed in a consistent way.

As our Institute grows day-by-day, so does the complexity of storing information related to the Institute and its members. We all face many issues such as: fees and dues of students, marks of students, timetables, examination schedules etc. mySpace will give maximum services in a single software product that can be used by Students, Faculty members and the System Administration.
