**Introduction**

**mySpace** is a system that manages the records of students and faculty members regarding results, examination, personal information etc. Through mySpace, extensive information will be available at your fingertips and at any time. Viewing student data, allocating classes and reshuffling, managing semester information, examination dates, subject management, result declaration and related issues are made simple and easy. mySpace will allow keeping data in a form that can be easily accessed and analysed in a consistent way.

As our Institute grows day-by-day, so does the complexity of storing information related to the Institute and its members. We all face many issues such as: fees and dues of students, marks of students, timetables, examination schedules etc. mySpace will give maximum services in a single software product that can be used by Students, Faculty members and the System Administration.

**Advantages**

Our project will adhere to, but not be limited to, the following:

**Complete Control**: With mySpace, every section of the institute could be managed from a single platform. It offers full control to monitor, manage, and access all the resources such as Exam Details, Fees Details, Timetable for the day and much more from a single platform.

**Time Saving**: Since we will be implementing an “Everything under One Roof” policy, the time spent on accessing various different resources for a specific task will be eliminated.

**No Need of Paperwork**: Since this will be a completely computerised approach to the storing and accessing information, the need of storing and handling paperwork is eliminated. 

**Easy Accessibility**: The administrator holds the full rights to all the information within the infrastructure. They can make changes to vital details instantly and keep an eye on any goof-ups in the data.

**Beneficial for the Students**: While the software will make the job of faculty and administrators easy, it will also help the students in many ways. Students can check the schedule for different courses and exams without hovering over the notice board.
